# Cookware-Website

Description:
Created a mock-website using flexbox, grid, and bootstrap. I created cards from scratch and stylized buttons, hero images, used hover effects. This was a very fun project. Wish I had more time to work on it. But in time, I will improve on how fast i can create things.
I need to work on the grid responsiveness, import text, and practice more on spacing.
